Abstract 

Given the numerous alternatives available, students may find it difficult to select a computer science field in which to specialize such as Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Computer System, Networking, Multimedia and Information System. Our proposed expert system is targeted for students who have completed their pre-university courses and are ready to embark on their university journey. It is a system that asks students questions regarding their personality and passion in order for the system to decide which computer science courses that are best suited to their individual personalities or passions. To perform this, the students put their information, students will answer the questions. Based on the information gathered from the students' answers, the system will use its knowledge base to identify student's interest in the computer science field and recommend a reasonable result to the students. By using the system, students can make informed decisions regarding their academic paths that will be engaging and fulfilling to their interests. The expert system provides a valuable service to the students, as it allows them to understand their strengths and weaknesses in selecting which programs that suit them best. In general, students who are thinking about enrolling in computer science courses or programs can benefit from using the expert system. It gives them tailored recommendations that support informed decision making and aid in choosing courses that are best suited to their preferences.
